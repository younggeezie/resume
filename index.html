    <p>I'm an <strong>IT Professional</strong> by day, and a <strong><a href="https://hockey-community.com/users/gilyoung/career" target="_blank">teammate</a></strong> by night.
    </p>
    <p>I studied English and Math at Capilano University, and took up all things IT at British Columbia University. Now, I <strong><a href="http://www.phsa.ca">support and manage healthcare imaging systems</strong></a> across BC.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of work, I’m a sports junkie. Most of my time is spent watching, researching, and playing sports. I'm always looking forward to the next beer league game - hockey, basketball, flag football, you name it. I will join any sports pool that I'm invited to.
    </p>

    <p>I have a more detailed <a href="resume.html"  target="_blank">résumé</a>.
